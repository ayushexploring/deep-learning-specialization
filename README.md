## Introduction
This repository contains my coursework for the Deep Learning Specialization and its courses. You will find assignment notebooks and datasets. Feel free to take any help from this repository.

## Course 1 - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)

Week 1 - Just an introduction with very basic terminologies related to Deep Learning.\
[Week 2](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%202) - [Python Basics with Numpy](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%202/Python%20Basics%20with%20Numpy/Python_Basics_With_Numpy_v3a.ipynb), [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%202/Logistic%20Regression%20as%20a%20Neural%20Network/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset_v6a.ipynb)\
[Week 3](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%203/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer) - [Planar data classification with one hidden layer](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%203/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer/Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer_v6c.ipynb)\
[Week 4](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/tree/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204) - [Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v8a.ipynb), [Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application](https://github.com/ayushexploring/deep-learning-specialization/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application_%20Image%20Classification/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application%20v8.ipynb)
